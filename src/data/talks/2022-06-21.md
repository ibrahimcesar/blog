## Lifting Privacy and Accessibility Up

_Base Camp Track Remote 13h50_

In React, Lifting State Up is a core concept. The aim of this talk is address two very important concerns in our landscape: privacy and accessibility and how we can achieve it and built in right from the components. This talk will show my work with a little open source component ad its evolution to address privacy and accessibility with the help of community and how we as developers need to care and ship the best for our people using our tools down to the most simple component.
