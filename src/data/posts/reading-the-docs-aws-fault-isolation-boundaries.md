[AWS Fault Isolation Boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/abstract-and-introduction.html) was first released on 2002, November, 16. Is a great addition.

## Abstract

> Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides different isolation boundaries, such as Availability Zones (AZ), Regions, control planes, and data planes. This paper details how AWS uses these boundaries to create zonal, Regional, and global services. It also includes prescriptive guidance on how to consider dependencies on these different services and how to improve the resilience of workloads you build using them.
