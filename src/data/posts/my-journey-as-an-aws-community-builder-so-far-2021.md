<p class="lead">Hi there. You‚Äôve made it.</p>

It was with this simple opening, [Jason Dunn](https://twitter.com/jasondunn), the [AWS Community Builders](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) Program Manager made my day. Well, my night in fact, it was October 16, almost 10pm. After the initial rush of joy, the impostor syndrome kicks in‚Äîas if Jason was reading my mind this sentence came: _You‚Äôre exactly the kind of person we‚Äôre looking for_. I felt welcomed. Being part of this community has been such an incredible gift. Now, after 6 months I looked back in my journey so far and can say without a doubt how my growth as a cloud professional was boosted by and from the community.

## The Great Flood of LinkedIn Contacts

After the welcome calls, the ‚ÄúCommunity Builder‚Äù started to materially, so to speak. We put on our LinkedIn and Twitter bios and used our organization, this very yours here in Dev.to and identified ourselves with logos, cover images.

This lead to we followed each other in several networks, but in LinkedIn was a Great Flood. In the early days were dozens and dozens of invites. Some people felt overwhelmed. For me, I can see, even is not a ‚Äúbusiness contact‚Äù or I fully know the person, I can say I enriched for sure my feed. In Brazil, the usual LinkedIn content is ‚Äúfell good‚Äù or ‚Äúhustle‚Äù stories or success cases. Then, I got content‚Äîgreat content from several aspects of the cloud.

I think I could found a quality in the quantity of new contacts of LinkedIn because we share somebody of knowledge, challenges and information we find relevant and common topics. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs makes a community.

## Random acts of kindness

Be a community builder can be also somewhat be a full-time job. As part of Amplify‚Äôs Discord, and with a ‚ÄúCommunity Badge‚Äù after interacting within one or another thread, people just popped from nowhere, sometimes without _any_ context, asking for my help, sometimes with code snippets and in frameworks and didn‚Äôt have any knowledge.

![Random requests](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ils2y7w4oub507rzha8.png)

My first approach was to treat this as ‚Äúrandom acts of kindness‚Äù‚ÄîI was once and I‚Äôm very often in the web looking for answers, what I can help just happened of I‚Äôve seem that before. I would help as much as I could and I even got surprised by helping people in frameworks I don‚Äôt have any leverage. _What_‚Äîthe snarky voice in my head says (and now writing in English, sounds exactly like [Corey Quinn‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/quinnypig)‚Äî_you are doing unpaid job and loving it_. Yes, that‚Äôs right. First, I volunteer. Second, my daily job is to help developers understand better their contexts and tools and doing this kind of invisible, no glamour job, makes me feel giving back to community as much as community gave to me. Every npm we download to our *node_modules* there're a person and a chunk of that person‚Äôs hours and life there. Most of the time I just point a way and people find themselves. And not one doesn‚Äôt say thanks until now (Side note: I can _barely_ imagine what could be the life of an _AWS hero_! If I, receive one or two per week of these, in several platforms: by email (I think they find through my LinkedIn or GitHub), Twitter or Discord, imagine they, with a much bigger platform and role). I grow helping others.

## Tupi or not tupi?

[Tupi people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupi_people) were one of the most many peoples indigenous to Brazil, before colonisation‚Äîand then, you know, the genocide happened and their lands became a country. But Tupi is sort of ‚ÄúBrazilian stamp‚Äù and it happens to sounds close enough of ‚ÄúTo be‚Äù and it was created by the Brazilian poet Oswald de Andrade in his 1928‚Äôs Manifesto Antropof√°gico, or [Anthropophagic Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto_Antrop%C3%B3fago). Earlier this year I made [a post with this phrase as title on my blog](https://ibrahimcesar.cloud/blog/tupi-or-not-tupi/).

Very simple example, `data` in Brazilian Portuguese is `date` in English. It looks little but `data` and `date` are so ubiquitous in programming, be front or backend that is easy to find someone confusing the terms or using one meaning to another and so on, because of the cognitive dissonance.

[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/), a software development news outlet has a Brazilian version that [published its last Brazilian Portuguese content in February 2021](https://www.infoq.com/br/news/2021/02/ultimo-conteudo-do-infoq-brasil/). This was the reason, in my attempt to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù:

> In these 12 years a lot has changed too. And one of the many changes was that more people, in this software development market, learned English. In special this more seniority level public InfoQ Brasil target. With domain in reading English, we realized that makes little sense to these people wait weeks, months, to consume a content in Portuguese translated by us (Translator‚Äôs Note: We Brazilians just call Brazilian Portuguese as Portuguese), with the original content at a click to be accessed.

> We realized English domain made people to write in English, making more difficult to get original content for InfoQ Brasil, which could be a nice to have for the Brazilian market. Believe or not, in 2020 we had more Brazilian people writing original content for InfoQ in English than Brazilian people writing original content for InfoQ in Portuguese.

There are a lot of incentives in play to this. The audience is bigger and, to be quite frank, there‚Äôs a _bias_ against content in Portuguese in relation to a content in English. I know this because _I_ have this bias, even writing original pieces in Portuguese for my blog, and committed to do so.

There are Brazilians developers that choose to do their total online presence in English, I don‚Äôt like the idea. It‚Äôs like had to act with an online persona than what I am ‚Äì a Brazilian developer in an interconnected World where English is on programming languages and the language where the most important conversations and discussions happen. I was afraid to even publish something other than my mother's language. Besides self taught programmer, I‚Äôm self taught in English as well. To find your ‚Äúvoice‚Äù even in your language is very difficult, is a process that you start by emulating others until you feel more comfortable, find your ‚Äúvoice‚Äù in another language is really _really_ difficult. And this was an issue because I didn‚Äôt want to create lists of things or just write for the sake of publish something in English. Then, inspired by a [promotion to first-time serverless writers](https://offbynone.io/new-serverless-writers/) from Serverless `Super`Hero Jeremy Daly‚Äôs [off-by-none](https://offbynone.io/) I published [Serverless Transformation at a news media outlet in Brazil](/blog/serverless-transformation-in-a-news-media-outlet-in-brazil/)

Which was a written version of a [talk I gave at Serverless Week 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icUhsz5OUCU&t=4150s) from AWS User Groups here in Brazil which was my first talk about anything Cloud. Here on dev.to and shut down the internet for the day and I ran to hide myself under the covers. I won one of tickets and the [The Developer‚Äôs Guide to Content Creation](https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/product-page/the-developer-s-guide-to-content-creation) gave a lot of insights on how to produce better content. I had this article for so much time in my draft and then... I got feedback. People came to talk to me.

Regarding the choice ‚ÄúTupi or not tupi?‚Äù my approach is not to choose. I tweet both in English and Brazilian Portuguese, use my personal blog for posts in my primary language and dev.to posts for content in English. There‚Äôs a lot of work to be done in Brazilian Portuguese to help educate and bring to teach people who lack the opportunities to learn and develop their English skills. And I‚Äôm committed to help my peers.

## Be heard, and listen

After that, I publish some post after, both in English and Portuguese. Engaged in some courses and the talks from AWS Community Builders help so so much. I have a tremendous respect for all Developer Advocates from AWS, and there are so many, but [James Beswick](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/compute/author/jbeswick/) help me a lot with all his great content. He motivated me to explore more of my writing. So, I worked on a long form piece I was thinking a lot about in the space of serverless. At the same time,  [The Developers Conference Innovation](https://thedevconf.com/tdc/2021/innovation/trilha-stadium-quinta) accepted a talk addressing the same subject only in a form of a question instead of an assertion: [‚ÄúServerless is Ready? We, Developers, are not‚Äù](https://ibrahimcesar.cloud/talks/2021-03-25-serverless-pronto/), so my focus was more on the side of make a case for Serverless readiness. So, for the first time I spoke at a large audience and held the honor to present myself as ‚ÄúAWS Community Builder‚Äù.

![About me](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qd1lsk6td4tf0qkr1cf1.png)

After that I [published the piece on a lot of concep](/blog/serverless-is-ready-developers-are-not/), I know I will sound a totally fanboy, but I was exploding in joy with the reception. They cited me in my favorite readings on serverless: 

[Off-by-none](https://offbynone.io/), _two_ times. I almost cried ü•≤

_And_ [Serverless Transformation](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/serverless-transformation) - by Theodo. You can see that even my first post in English. how much they influenced me.

I could not believe! I got featured on my own _Big Three_ source of news for serverless and resonate with people I respect from the community.

## Technology _is_ political. And be part of a community is political _too_

‚ÄúPolitical‚Äù is for some people like a ‚Äúreserved‚Äù word we can‚Äôt use in certain contexts or at all in tech. I think is misled, confusing partisan with political. Politics is the set of activities that are associated with deciding in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. A technology is a tool that is used by people for some purpose, usually to further their own interests in a society comprising other people. That makes it political.

So being part of the AWS Community Builders gave so much: a ‚Äúplace‚Äù to feel welcomed, peers I admire, access to so much content and people that I can learn a lot (and for Brazilians, right now, courses or anything paid in dollar is very difficult‚ÄîA financial benefit I got from the program was a free voucher to the Solutions Architect exam - which I passed last February). And even without any coordination I was fortunate enough to appear in [AWS Startups on my birthday](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/blogs/startups/news-startup-nexo-runs-a-lean-tech-team-by-leveraging-aws-and-amplify/)!

Even when you feel cannot make a difference as an individual, you can still make a difference in a group. I expect to be giving as much as I‚Äôm receiving as an AWS Community Builder.

A great thank you, **Jason Dunn** and **Elise Greve**! You made the difference for me! I hope others along the way!
