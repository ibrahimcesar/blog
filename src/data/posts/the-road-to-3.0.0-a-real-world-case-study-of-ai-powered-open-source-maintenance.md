<p class="lead">I've maintained react-lite-youtube-embed for over three years, watching it grow to thousands of weekly downloads. But like many open source maintainers, I carried a quiet anxiety: What issues am I missing? For version 3.0.0, I decided to try something different—I invited Claude Code to perform a comprehensive code review. What happened next surprised me: 21 improvement opportunities emerged, spanning critical bugs in React hooks, performance optimizations, accessibility enhancements, and even supply chain security with SLSA Level 3 provenance. Over 7 pull requests and zero breaking changes, my component was transformed. This is the honest story of using AI as a co-maintainer, what worked, what I learned, and how it changed my approach to open source development.</p>
