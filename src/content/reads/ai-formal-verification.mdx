## Summary

Kleppmann argues that AI will transform formal verification from a niche academic pursuit into mainstream software engineering. Formal verification—mathematically proving code correctness—has traditionally been prohibitively expensive, requiring "23 lines of proof and half a person-day for every single line of implementation."

However, LLM-based coding assistants are becoming skilled at writing proof scripts, which could dramatically reduce costs. This shift matters because AI-generated code needs formal verification rather than human review for reliability. As automation handles proof generation, the focus will shift to specifying what properties code should satisfy—a more manageable challenge.

## My thoughts

Fascinating prediction from the author of [**"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"**](https://amzn.to/44eUVLe), one of my favorite book. The economics argument is compelling: if AI makes proof-writing cheap, formal verification becomes viable. The cultural shift will be the harder part. But looking forward to it!
