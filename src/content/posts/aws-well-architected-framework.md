> The AWS Constitution, [**AWS Well-Architected Framework**](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) is a White Paper and a series of independent publications such the five pillars: Reliability, Performance, Operational Excellence, Cost, and Security; and the lenses.

## 📖 What

But White Papers counts a book? I should to started in a very unorthodox way for main two reasons: Our definition of a book is a product. A lengthy piece of fiction, non-fiction or sometimes just pictures, created with certain restrictions and advantages about other ways to transfer knowledge or entertainment. The second one is my respect for this work that spans 12 works, with some overlapping, and the foundation one, the “Player's Book” (or I should call it “Master's Book”?) with 94 pages in its PDF version. As the time of this writing, the total page count is 721 in the PDF offerings. Sure it is not “War and Peace” but is over three times “The Great Gatsby", so take that Fitzgerald.

And also is totally free. The cynical bone in everyone could say that is just “Marketing”, but I don't think is a fair assessment. There are a lot of citations and recommendations directly to AWS offerings, but you'll not find any book about patterns in architecture of cloud so well thought and put together in the wild. Is said that everything in the Well Architected is something that is collected from around 80% of its customers before entering the book.

You can read [The Well Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) Framework in HTML, Kind and PDF. And the former you can even print on dead threes.

## 🌟 Why Matters?

With the word, [Dr. Werner Vogels, AWS CTO](https://twiiter.com/Werner) of the famous quote “Everything fails all the time”, both painful and very real.

## 🔖 Highlights

> AWS best practices emerge from our experience running thousands of systems at internet scale. We prefer to use data to define best practice, but we also use subject matter experts, like principal engineers, to set them. As principal engineers see new best practices emerge, they work as a community to ensure that teams follow them. In time, these best practices are formalized into our internal review processes, as well as into mechanisms that enforce compliance. The Well-Architected Framework is the customer-facing implementation of our internal review process, where we have codified our principal engineering thinking across ﬁeld roles, like Solutions Architecture and internal engineering teams. The Well-Architected Framework is a scalable mechanism that lets you take advantage of these learnings.

> Successful evolution of operations is founded in: frequent small improvements; providing safe environments and time to experiment, develop, and test improvements; and environments in which learning from failures is encouraged. Operations support for sandbox, development, test, and production environments, with increasing level of operational controls, facilitates development and increases the predictability of successful results from changes deployed into production.
