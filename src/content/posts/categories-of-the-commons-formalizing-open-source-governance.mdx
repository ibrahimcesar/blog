Why do some open source projects thrive for decades while others collapse under their own success? Why did Node.js fork into io.js? Why do single-maintainer projects like curl sustain critical infrastructure while well-funded foundations sometimes struggle? I'm announcing **Categories of the Commons**, my MBA thesis research that applies category theory, sheaf cohomology, and cybernetics to formalize open source governance—and potentially predict governance crises before they happen.

## The Problem

Open source software powers everything. Your browser, your phone, the servers behind every website—all built on a foundation of commons-based peer production. Yet we lack formal frameworks for understanding *why* some projects succeed while others fail.

Consider these patterns:

- **curl** has been maintained primarily by Daniel Stenberg for 25+ years, serving as critical infrastructure for millions of systems
- **core-js** sustains the JavaScript ecosystem while its maintainer struggles financially
- **Kubernetes** thrives with hundreds of contributors and formal governance
- **io.js** forked from Node.js due to governance conflicts, then merged back

What makes these outcomes different? Can we formalize the difference?

## The Framework

My research synthesizes four intellectual traditions:

### 1. Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM)

Beer identified five systems necessary for organizational viability. In OSS terms:

| System | Function | OSS Manifestation |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| S1 | Operations | Commits, PRs, releases |
| S2 | Coordination | CI/CD, review processes, CONTRIBUTING.md |
| S3 | Control | Metrics, release management |
| S4 | Intelligence | Roadmaps, ecosystem monitoring |
| S5 | Policy | Governance docs, mission, identity |

### 2. Elinor Ostrom's Commons Governance

Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for showing that commons can be governed successfully. Her 8 design principles map to OSS—but with a twist: they predict success for **Federations** (Kubernetes, Linux) but fail for **Stadiums** (curl, SQLite).

### 3. Nadia Asparouhova's OSS Taxonomy

From *Working in Public*, four project types based on user growth vs. contributor growth:

```
                    CONTRIBUTOR GROWTH
                    Low              High
                ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
           High │   STADIUM   │ FEDERATION  │
  USER          │  curl, npm  │  Linux, K8s │
 GROWTH         ├─────────────┼─────────────┤
           Low  │    TOYS     │    CLUBS    │
                │  Personal   │  Niche FWs  │
                └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### 4. Category Theory & Sheaf Cohomology

Here's where it gets interesting. Category theory provides the **compositional semantics**—how governance structures combine and transform. But the real innovation is applying **sheaf theory**:

- Treat OSS projects as **topological spaces**
- Governance rules become **sheaf sections**
- The **gluing axiom** captures how local decisions must combine into coherent global policy
- **Čech cohomology** measures governance coherence

The cohomology groups have concrete interpretations:

| Group | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| H⁰ | Global consensus (universal rules) |
| H¹ | Governance conflicts (incompatible local policies) |
| H² | Structural obstructions (deep incompatibilities) |

## The Hypothesis

**Main Conjecture:** Non-trivial H² cohomology classes precede fork events by 6-12 months.

In plain terms: when a project has deep structural governance incompatibilities—situations where three parties A, B, C agree pairwise but can't all agree together—a fork becomes likely.

This is testable. We can reconstruct historical project states for known forks (Node.js/io.js, Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash, OpenOffice/LibreOffice) and check if H² spiked before the split.

## The Research Design

I'm taking a **Stadium-focused approach**:

- **28-30 Stadium projects** (curl, core-js, axios, etc.) — maximum categorical signal
- **12-15 Federation projects** (Kubernetes, Rust, Node.js) — baseline
- **8-10 Club projects** — convergent case
- **15-20 Control projects** — noise estimation

Why Stadium-heavy? These projects are **terminal objects** in the organizational constraint category. With ≤3 maintainers handling massive usage, they exhibit the clearest governance structure-to-entropy mapping.

## Early Findings

I've collected data on 13 projects so far. Early patterns emerging:

1. **Entropy correlates with governance type** — Stadium projects show distinct entropy profiles
2. **Dominance ratio > 40%** is a strong Stadium indicator
3. **Governance files matter** — presence of CONTRIBUTING.md, CODEOWNERS significantly affects cohomology

## What's Next

The research continues through early 2025:

1. **Complete data collection** — 60-75 projects across all categories
2. **Implement full cohomology calculation** — using GUDHI for proper simplicial homology
3. **Fork prediction study** — test the H² hypothesis on historical data
4. **Write the thesis** — formalize the categorical-cybernetic framework

## Open Source, Open Research

The entire project is open source:

**Repository:** [github.com/ibrahimcesar/categories-of-the-commons](https://github.com/ibrahimcesar/categories-of-the-commons)

- Data collection scripts
- Entropy calculation modules
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- The complete sheaf-theoretic framework (in `theory/sheaf-cohomology-framework.md`)

## Why This Matters

Beyond academic interest, this research could have practical applications:

1. **Early warning systems** for governance crises
2. **Diagnostic tools** for foundation-backed projects
3. **Better understanding** of when to apply Ostrom's principles vs. other approaches
4. **Mathematical foundation** for studying organizational health

If you maintain an open source project, especially a Stadium-type one, I'd love to include it in the study. If you're interested in category theory applied to real-world systems, the theoretical framework might interest you.
