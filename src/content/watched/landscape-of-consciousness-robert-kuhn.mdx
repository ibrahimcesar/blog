## My thoughts

His article, "A Landscape of Consciousness: Toward a Taxonomy of Explanations and Implications," does not seek to evaluate or adjudicate among these theories, but rather to classify and arrange them. In doing so, Kuhn offers the first comprehensive scientific overview of how humanity conceives of consciousness and its metaphysical underpinnings in 2025.

In this conversation, Hans Busstra talks to Kuhn about the categories of his map and the metaphysical commitments they imply. While Kuhn was careful to remain neutral in his published work, here he speaks more openly—sharing which theories he finds more or less plausible.
