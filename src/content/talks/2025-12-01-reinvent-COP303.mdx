In this session, I'll demonstrate practical techniques using Amazon Q Developer, AWS Resilience Hub, and AWS Systems Manager to generate and validate recovery runbooks:

- Craft effective prompts for architecture-aware recovery plans
- Generate and validate disaster recovery runbooks automatically
- Modernize your disaster recovery strategy with generative AI
- Reduce risk and improve operational resilience through automation
