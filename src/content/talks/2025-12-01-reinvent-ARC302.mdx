Join me and our world-class team of builders **Emir Ayar**, **Carlos Perez**, **Krupanidhi Jay** and **Ryan Dsouza** for this hands-on builders' session.

<TalkImage src="/talks/re-invent-1.jpeg" alt="ARC302 - AI-powered Well-Architected reviews: Building automated governance" title="AWS re:Invent 2025" />

In this session, we'll explore how generative AI transforms architectural governance:

- Leverage Amazon Q Developer with MCP servers for intelligent code analysis
- Automate Well-Architected reviews of your infrastructure code
- Generate recommendations and implement fixes through automated PRs
- Transform manual reviews into scalable, automated processes
